<p><span style="font-size: small;">George Floyd, Ahmaud Arbery, Breonna Taylor, and countless others from the Black community have been murdered at the hands of police brutality.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: small;">These problems also reach much deeper than the latest window into institutionalized racism in our country.&nbsp;</span></p>

                <div dir="ltr">I&#39;ve had a lot of discussions lately on how white people (myself included) can better navigate learning, conversation, and how to use the platforms we have. To avoid using this platform for centering, which is why I&#39;m sharing my thoughts and actions for those who are interested here.</div>
                <div dir="ltr"><br></div>
                <div dir="ltr">I accept my words here are problematic and I don&#39;t know how yet, but I&#39;m open to correction (as a supplement to RTFM work I&#39;m doing).&nbsp;</div>
                <div dir="ltr"><br></div>
                <div dir="ltr">With that said, here is what I&#39;ve been doing to address my own role in propagating racism:&nbsp;</div>
                <div dir="ltr">
                    <div class="gmail_default"><br>- <strong>LISTENING, READING, WATCHING:</strong> Currently, I&#39;m listening to #1619project, and challenging myself to take notes on deeper reflections, but am first seeking commentary from Black voices instead of promoting my own. Also, following Black voices on social media, which was absolutely mostly white women- that was a mirror I didn&#39;t see until now (speaking of mirrors, I highly recommend watching Little Fires Everywhere). Book-wise, I am re-reading White Fragility (honestly, there&#39;s so much to unpack there). Next up is A People&#39;s History of the United States (Howard Zinn). I&#39;ve realized my lack of interest in history- being able to treat it as just another topic I had to memorize dates for in highschool- &nbsp;is a glaring example white privilege.&nbsp;</div>
                    <div class="gmail_default"><br></div>
                    <div class="gmail_default">- <strong>THINKING:</strong> I&#39;ve been thinking a lot about how the way I grew up shaped my beliefs and approaches to addressing things, and what my role and behavior moving forward should look like. If you&#39;re someone open and willing to have deeper conversations on this, let me know. Systematic and internalized racism, and how to dismantle it, is not something that is easy to think about, and there are a lot of conflicting takes on pretty much every aspect of it. I&#39;ve been deeply uncomfortable knowing that whatever action or inaction I take, or idea I verbalize, I&#39;m stepping on a Black voice who disagrees. I&#39;m accepting the discomfort as a new normal, and addressing the cognitive dissonance that I am going to do bad things by trying to do good things. I will devote my energy to minimizing the bad with what I can do consciously, and mitigate the remaining bad by simply making room for Black voices. I think this is better than doing nothing.&nbsp;</div>
                    <div class="gmail_default"><br></div>
                    <div class="gmail_default">
                        <div class="gmail_default">- <strong>SPEAKING:&nbsp;</strong>The three main spaces I&#39;ve been concentrating on being vocal in are group chats, instagram stories, and at my place of work. As a white person in tech and a people manager, I feel that I have the opportunity to have an impact, and should use it. Those of you who work with me know I&#39;ve been bringing the conversation to our 9-5 (and I&#39;m grateful for those of you doing the same). I&#39;ve been having honest and hard conversations (with lots of research beforehand), and setting up educational opportunities at work to amplify what the problems are, how we got here, paths forward, and how to address cultural and media portrayal of what&#39;s going on. Wrt instagram, IG stories is the platform feature I&#39;ve always used the most (and seems same for others on here) - I continue to share and amplify Black voices and ideas there.</div>
                    </div>
                    <div class="gmail_default"><br>- <strong>FINANCIAL SUPPORT:</strong> Not much on this, but obviously putting my privileged $$ where my mouth is. Combined with the support of my network, over $1.5k was donated through last weekend&#39;s matching challenge. I have set up recurring donations to NAACP LDF as well.&nbsp;</div>
                    <div class="gmail_default"><br>Still doesn&#39;t feel like enough, and that&#39;s because it never will be. But I&#39;m committed to maxing out what I can do. I stand with the Black community, and I will be here after we defund the police.</div>
